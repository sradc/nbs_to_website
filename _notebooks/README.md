# nb_to_website

```
Todo:
- Turn a directory of notebooks into a website,
- format of the site:
  / - homepage (contains list of posts, and other info)
  /posts - only list of posts
  /posts/nb_name - post for each notebook

Have the functionality of /posts/nb_name.ipynb, to get the whole notebook.

Would be nice:
- Be able to have notebook and cell metadata
- Dark mode/light mode
- Having collapsible cells/outputs/cells&outputs
- Picking a nice font
- Moving images from base64 into their own img files, filename based on hash, for browser caching.
- Converting historic posts into this format.
- Post commit git hook that runs the website generator.
- Use system fonts, e.g. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364048/we-are-switching-to-system-fonts-on-may-10-2021
- Put my current website side to side with this, check it's ok (on desktop/mobile/ipad)
- wider code blocks (sticking out), slightly smaller font
```
